# PID-DEMO-PENDULUM

A physics simulation to demonstrate a PID controller, balancing an inverted pendulum.

## FBS

System is broken down into three functional modules:

1. Controller. Responsible for determining the control output to the cart, to balance the pendulum.
2. Physics simulation. Responsible for simuating the motion of the cart and pendulum.
3. Input and output. Responsible for displaying the results of the simulation, and adjusting simulation values.
